# CSC8502

## Description

This program was written for a university course module: CSC8502 "Advanced Graphics for Games".\
\
When the program runs it'll take you through an on-rails tour of the landscape, showing off graphical features and transitioning to a new landscape midway through, ending at a splitscreen camera. The tour can be ended with a keypress, allowing for free-camera movement and toggleable features.\
\
The landscape depicts an early Earth era lava-filled hellscape and then fades into the same land in the modern age where a forest and plains have grown.
